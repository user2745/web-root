"Firefly III" is a financial manager. It can help you keep track of expenses, income, budgets and everything in between. It even supports credit cards, shared household accounts and savings accounts! It’s pretty fancy. You should use it to save and organise money.

Firefly works on the principle that if you know where you’re money is going, you can stop it from going there.
