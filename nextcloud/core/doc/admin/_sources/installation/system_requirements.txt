===================
System requirements
===================

Memory
------

Memory requirements for running an Nextcloud server are greatly variable, 
depending on the numbers of users and files, and volume of server activity. 
Nextcloud needs a minimum of 128MB RAM, and we recommend a minimum of 512MB.

Recommended setup for running Nextcloud
---------------------------------------

For best performance, stability, and functionality, recommendations are:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 / Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* MySQL/MariaDB
* PHP 7.0, 7.1 or 7.2.
* Apache 2.4 with mod_php

For a Nextcloud installation with efficient and reliable scaling over ~100 users, see the `deployment recommendations <https://portal.nextcloud.com/article/nextcloud-deployment-recommendations-7.html>`_.

See :doc:`source_installation` for minimum software versions for installing 
Nextcloud. If you encounter problems, visit the `home user forums <https://help.nextcloud.com>`_
or `enterprise support portal <https://portal.nextcloud.com>`_.

Database requirements for MySQL / MariaDB
-----------------------------------------

The following is currently required if you're running Nextcloud together with a MySQL / MariaDB database:

* InnoDB storage engine (MyISAM is not supported)
* "READ COMMITED" transaction isolation level (See: :ref:`db-transaction-label`)
* Disabled or BINLOG_FORMAT = ROW configured Binary Logging (See: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/binary-log-formats.html)

Emoji (UTF8 4-byte) support with MySQL / MariaDB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to use UTF8 4-byte characters such as Emojis on your server, the database needs to be created with character set ``utf8mb4`` and collate ``utf8mb4_general_ci``, e.g.::

  CREATE DATABASE nextcloud CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;

Additionally the following InnoDB settings need to be set::

  [mysqld]
  innodb_large_prefix=on
  innodb_file_format=barracuda
  innodb_file_per_table=true

See :doc:`../configuration_database/mysql_4byte_support` for more information.
